Qdrant is a vector database designed for semantic search and similarity search.
It stores embeddings and retrieves vectors based on cosine similarity.
Qdrant supports filtering, payload storage, and batch operations.
It can handle millions of vectors with sub-millisecond search speed.
Qdrant is ideal for building RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems.
